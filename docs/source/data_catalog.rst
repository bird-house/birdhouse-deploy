Data Catalog
============

Pavics offers intake `catalogs <pavics.ouranos.ca/catalog>`_ for different collections hosted on the THREDDS server. Loading those catalog requires the `Intake-ESM <https://intake-esm.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_ extension installed, together with Intake.

Work is underway to host a SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog (`STAC <https://stacspec.org/en>`_).
