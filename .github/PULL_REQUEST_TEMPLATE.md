## CI Operations

<!--
  The test suite can be run using a different DACCS config with ``birdhouse_daccs_configs_branch: branch_name`` in the PR description.
  To globally skip the test suite regardless of the commit message use ``birdhouse_skip_ci`` set to ``true`` in the PR description.

  Using ``[<cmd>]`` (with the brackets) where ``<cmd> = skip ci`` in the commit message will override ``birdhouse_skip_ci`` from the PR description.
  Such commit command can be used to override the PR description behavior for a specific commit update.
  However, a commit message cannot 'force run' a PR which the description turns off the CI.
  To run the CI, the PR should instead be updated with a ``true`` value, and a running message can be posted in following PR comments to trigger tests once again.
