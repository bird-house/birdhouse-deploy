#!/bin/sh
# This script is meant to be sourced by all scripts needing to read default.env
# or env.local.
#
# Normally only read_configs() is needed, but for any special needs, each step
# can be called individually.
#
# When not using read_configs(), caller is responsible for knowing the proper
# sequence to read the config files, for hiding password when reading env.local
# and to call process_delayed_eval() to have fully usable resolved variable
# values.
#
# USAGE:
#  # Set variable COMPOSE_DIR to the dir containing pavics-compose.sh and
#  # docker-compose.yml.
#
#  # Source the script providing function read_configs.
#  # read_configs uses COMPOSE_DIR to find default.env and env.local.
#  . $COMPOSE_DIR/read-configs.include.sh
#
#  # Call function read_configs to read the various config files in the
#  # appropriate order and process delayed eval vars properly.
