Basic usage examples:

- store backups in a repository located at the /tmp/backup directory on the same machine that runs birdhouse

  RESTIC_REPOSITORY=/tmp/backup
  RESTIC_PASSWORD=mysupersecretpassword

- store backups in a repository located at the /tmp/backup directory on a different machine using SFTP to move data

  RESTIC_REPOSITORY=sftp:user@otherhost:/tmp/backup
  RESTIC_PASSWORD=mysupersecretpassword

  Backups over sftp also require that you've set the 

# TODO: test restic over sftp: do we need to set a known_hosts file?
#       - create a `birdhouse backup restic` command to run restic with all settings to ensure that restic repo is accessible with current settings
#       - create a `birdhouse backup recover command to recover backups to the running stack

Restic also supports backing up data to various other repository locations including AWS, Azure, S3, restic REST server, and many more.
