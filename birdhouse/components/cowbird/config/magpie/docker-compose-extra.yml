      #   Although the file uses the combined "config.yml" format, it is very important to pass it as independent and
      #   duplicate references for providers/permissions/webhooks config files. This is because 'MAGPIE_CONFIG_PATH' is
      #   not used to allow parsing additive per-component config files for each extendable service, using loading of
      #   all configuration files found in mounted directories.
