# [Required] This section defines how to synchronize permissions between services when they share resources
sync_permissions:
  # Friendly name to identify a sync point (The value is not used by Cowbird so this can be any relevant keyword)
  user_workspace:
    # [Required] This section defines a list of services and resources that exists in Magpie.
    # For more info on the services available in Magpie :
    #     https://pavics-magpie.readthedocs.io/en/latest/services.html#available-services
    #     https://pavics-magpie.readthedocs.io/en/latest/autoapi/magpie/services/index.html
    services: # Contains the different resources that can be synchronized, ordered by service
      thredds: # Service name, which should also exist in Magpie
        # Resource key (ex.: thredds_workspace): Custom name to represent a resource path.
        #
        # Example of resource that uses variables and a `MULTI_TOKEN`.
        # Here, with the config below, if we have an input resource path
        # `/geoserver/workspaces/user_xyz/dir1/dir2/file_abc` that matches with the `geoserver_workspace` resource key,
        # the `user` variable name would be matched with `user_xyz` and `synced_file`, with `file_abc`.
        # Also, this key would need to sync permissions with the `thredds_workspace` resource key, considering the
        # `permissions_mapping` defined below. The `thredds_workspace` would be deduced to the resource path
        # `/catalog/workspaces/user_xyz/dir1/dir2/subdir/file_abc`.
        # The types of each segment of this target resource path would be deduced
        # from the `thredds_workspace` config below.

    # [Required] This section defines an array of permissions mapping between services
    # Each item found in the `permissions_mapping` uses the following format :
    #     resource_key1 : <permissions1> <mapping> resource_key2 : <permissions2>
    # <permissionsX> is defined as a single permission or a list of permissions :
    #     `permission | [permission1, permission2, ...]`
    # <mapping> is defined as a unidirectional or bidirectional arrow : `-> | <- | <->`
    #
    # The permissions can either be a single permission or a list of permissions. Each of those permissions can either
    # use an implicit format (`<name>` or `<name>-match`) or an explicit format (`<name>-<access>-<scope>`).
    # When using an implicit format, if the access and/or scope are not specified, it will use the default
    # access `allow` and/or the default scope `recursive`.

    # See documentation 'Configuration' for more details on the mapping and synchronization features
    permissions_mapping:
      # A `read` permission for `thredds_workspace` creates/deletes all specified `geoserver_workspace` permissions.
