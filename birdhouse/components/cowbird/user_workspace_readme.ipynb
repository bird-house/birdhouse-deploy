    "- Renaming a shapefile (.shp only) :\n",
    "\n",
    "    This operation is actually supported, but it should be avoided if possible. It will trigger multiple events on\n",
    "    the file system (an update on the parent directory, and a delete followed by a create event on the file), which \n",
    "    should keep up-to-date info in GeoServer and Magpie by simply generating new resources. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    A risk with this is that the delete event will delete the other shapefile files, and the user could lose some \n",
    "    data. It is better to have a copy of the shapefile before applying this operation. Note that renaming one of \n",
    "    the other extensions (not the .shp file) will not trigger any event since only the main file triggers events.\n",

    "    datastore directory should only be deleted when a user is deleted via Magpie."
