# NOTE:
#   Most WPS birds do not have a concept of Public vs User-specific outputs.
#   These birds will employ the same WPS output directory for all jobs, regardless of the user running it.
#   By default, WPS output files will be stored under '${WPS_OUTPUTS_DIR}/<bird>', and must all be considered 'public'.
#   Some WPS-capable birds such as Weaver do have a concept of Public/User-context for WPS outputs.
#   In this case, files under '${WPS_OUTPUTS_DIR}/<bird>' should have an additional nesting
#   with 'public' and 'users/{user_id}'. Variable 'PUBLIC_WORKSPACE_WPS_OUTPUTS_SUBDIR' will be shared for such cases.
