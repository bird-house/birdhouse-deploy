# Resource limits for JupyterLab containers. Resource limits can be set per Magpie user or group.
# The value for this variable is a whitespace delimited string. Each section is delimited by colons (:) 
# where the first element is either `group` or `user` and the second element is the name of the user or group
# to apply the limits to. The rest are resource limits of the form `limit=amount`. For example:
#
#  export JUPYTERHUB_RESOURCE_LIMITS="
#     user:user1:mem_limit=30G
#     group:group1:mem_limit=10G:cpu_limit=1
#     group:group2:cpu_limit=3:gpu_ids=gpu1,gpu2,gpu3
#     user:user2:gpu_ids=gpu1,gpu2,gpu3:gpu_count=2
#  "
#
#  Supported limits are: `mem_limit`, `cpu_limit`, `gpu_count`, `gpu_ids`. See the Jupyterhub Dockerspawner documentation
#  for details and supported values for mem_limit and cpu_limit.
#   - https://jupyterhub-dockerspawner.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/index.html#dockerspawner.DockerSpawner.cpu_limit
#   - https://jupyterhub-dockerspawner.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/index.html#dockerspawner.DockerSpawner.mem_limit
#  gpu_ids are a comma separated list of the GPU ids available on the host that you want to make available to
#  the user or group. GPU ids can typically be discovered by running the `nvidia-smi` command.
#  If gpu_count is also specified, this is an integer indicating how many GPUs to make available to that user or group.
#  For example, if gpu_ids=gpu1,gpu2,gpu6 and gpu_count=2 then two GPUs will be randomly selected from the gpu_ids list.
#  Note that this will not create the groups in Magpie, that must be done manually.
#  Note that if a user belongs to multiple groups, later values in `JUPYTERHUB_RESOURCE_LIMITS` will take
#  precedence. For example, if a user named user1 belongs to group1 and group2 then the following limits will apply:
#  - mem_limit=10G (because group1 is later in the list)
#  - cpu_limit=3 (because group2 is later in the list)
#  - gpu_ids=gpu1,gpu2,gpu3
