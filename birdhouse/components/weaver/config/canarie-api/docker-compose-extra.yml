      #   the weaver config, and then all python configuration within 'optional-components/canarie-api-full-monitoring'.
      #   It is important to load Weaver before, as the full monitoring need to know if 'Weaver' service is added to the
      #   stack in order to apply the corresponding public endpoint conditionally.
